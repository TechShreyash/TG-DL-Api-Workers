Certainly! Let's improve the "Note" section. Here are the revised instructions:

## Important Note

- Use a **Telegram channel**, not a group.
- Your file must **not contain a forward tag**, and it must not be forwarded with a forward tag.
- The bot must have **edit rights inside the channel**.
- To use this API, your file size must be **less than 20 MB**. Wondering why? Read more about it [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile).
